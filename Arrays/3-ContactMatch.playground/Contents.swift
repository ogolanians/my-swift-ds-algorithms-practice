/*
 When someone searches their contacts based on a phone number, it's nice when a list
 of contact pops up.
 
 Write an algorithm that searches your contacts for phone number strings, and returns:
  - NO CONTACT if contact can't be found
  - A contact if a contact is found
  - The first alphabetized contact if there are multiple
 
 A = ["pim", "pom"]             // Contacts (return one of these)
 B = ["", "999999999777888999"] // Phone numbers for each contact A[i] = B[i]
 P = "88999"                    // Search phrase

 Answer should be correct. Don't worry about performance.
