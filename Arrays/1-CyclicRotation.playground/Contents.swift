 For example, given

     A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
     K = 3
 the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:

     [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
     [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
     [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]

    var result = A
    return result
}

solution(A: [3, 8, 9, 7, 6], K: 3)
